Hi everyone,

My name is Tudor, a freshly new taught Front-End Developer.  Here will be displayed the milestones of my learning journey, as in personal projects, as well as future work related projects. 
Nerd at the core, with an interest in videogames, roleplaying tabletop games like DnD, photography and Tardises.

Allons-y !
